This template is based on the code of [Min-Zhong “John”
Lu](https://github.com/mnjul), where he uses R, CSS and the pagedown
package to create a html resume/ curriculum vitae.

## Compatibility issues

[Min-Zhong “John” Lu](https://github.com/mnjul/html-resume) gives a
comprehensive breakdown on possible compatibility issues, and I can
definitely recommend going to his repo to look at the details.
